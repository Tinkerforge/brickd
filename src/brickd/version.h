// the version number will be printed if the --version option is present. it
// will also be included in some initial log messages and used as version of
// the Debian package. therefore, it has to follow the Debian package version
// number format:
//
// [<epoch>:]<upstream-version>[-<debian-revision>]
//
// we don't want to set an <epoch> nor a <debian-revision>. therefore, our part
// (the <upstream-version>) can neither contain a : (colon) nor a - (hyphen) as
// this would make Debian interpret the version number wrong. the only allowed
// characters are [a-zA-Z0-9+.~]. see the Debian manual for more details:
